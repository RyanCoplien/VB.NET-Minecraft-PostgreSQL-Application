# VB.NET Minecraft PostgreSQL Application
This project was made by Ryan Coplien, Brandon Conway, and Kasey Tippelt for our CS 3630 Database Design and Implementation Course

It is a VB.NET GUI that sorts through a PostgreSQL Database using data source tables. The data is primarily based around Minecraft objects. 

The project contains a SQL script to create the database, an ER-diagram of the database, and a powerpoint made to briefly present the application.
